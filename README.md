# Sessionweb
Sessionweb is a free tool to manage session-based test management(SBTM). Project is hosted at Google code where both source code and downloads are available.

It was designed as a replacement for the traditional text files that was produced using the technique describe by James and Jon Bash. The reason was that the testers started to introduce new tags etc in the text files that broke the script that parsed the text files. The solution was to put everything in a database with a web frontend. Sessionweb was born due to this in late 2010.
