    <h2>Benefits of HTML5 canvas graphs</h2>
    
    <p>
        HTML5 introduces a new HTML element - the CANVAS tag. This tag allows for two dimensional drawing easily using Javascript.
        This makes it perfect for producing graphs. Because Javascript runs on your users computer, none of the stress on your server
        normally associated with producing graphs is incurred. Not only that but because
        of the greater processing power that is typically available on users' computers, they will be much faster. And,
        because the code can be both compressed (for example if you're using Apache, mod_gzip will do this automatically for you) and
        cached, bandwidth usage can be massively reduced. This makes it economically attractive to employ, (ie <b>it can save you
        money...</b>).
    </p>

    <p>
        Imagine, you are creating 100,000 graphs a day and the data is such that the resulting graphs cannot be cached. With the RGraph
        library you can reduce that figure to zero. All the processing and graph creation is done by each individual client, much like
        rendering the HTML you send to them. So you don't have to send any images, you simply send them the Javascript libraries once.
        So, much lower bandwidth bills and far less strain on your webserver.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And if that wasn't enough, because the graphs are created using Javascript, they will work offline if you view a .html page
        on your own PC. Download the archive and see! Useful if you need to do a presentation for example and want to use the same
        graph(s) as your website.
    </p>

    <a name="browser"></a>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
    <h2>Browser support</h2>
    
    <p>
        Since the graphs are produced using HTML5 features (the new <b>canvas</b> tag), client support is currently:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox 3.0+</li>
        <li>Google Chrome 1+</li>
        <li>Apple Safari 3+</li>
        <li>Opera 9.5+</li>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+ (see note)</li>
        <li>iPhone (text support from iOS v4+)</li>
        <li>iPad (text support from iOS v4.2+)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The HTML5 canvas tag is part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/" target="_blank">HTML5 specification</a>,
        and all of the above browsers have some sort of support for it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Canvas &amp; Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE)</b><br />
        Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 doesn't natively support the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; tag. To support
        MSIE 8 you will need to use either
        <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/" target="_blank">Google Chrome Frame</a> or
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/" target="_blank">ExCanvas from Google</a>
        (which is included in the RGraph archive). Read more about Internet Explorer compatibility
        <a href="msie.html">here</a>.
        
        <p />
        
        <span style="color: #090">
            Starting with preview 3 <b style="color: black">Microsoft Internet Explorer 9</b> has full support for &lt;canvas&gt;. You can view some screenshots
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rgraph/browse_thread/thread/c5651ff8c56b8f3c#" target="_blank">here</a>.
            MSIE 6 and 7 are supported by way of Google Chrome Frame.
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>RGraph and older browsers</b><br />
        Older browsers (eg Chrome 1, Firefox 3, Safari 3, Opera 9.5) are supported, however if they don't support the canvas shadow or
        text APIs, these will naturally be unavailable. Earlier versions of these browsers may work, but are untested.

    <a name="performance"></a>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
    <h2>Improving the performance of your graphs</h2>
    
    <p>
        Although performance is excellent, (traditionally your webserver has been
        producing all of your graphs, and now the client produces them, and typically only one at a time), you may still want to tune
        RGraph further. The biggest thing you can do is use compression, which reduces the initial download time of the libraries, but
        there are a number of things you can do:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Compression</b><br />HTTP compression can dramatically reduce your bandwidth bills and increase the speed
            of your website. The RGraph.common.core.js file for example used to be over 100k, but with compression this was reduced
            to around 17k. Less than a fifth of the original size! <span style="color: red">If you do only one thing to aid performance,
            then it should be this.</span>
            
            <p>
                To achieve this with Apache you have a few options:
            </p>
            
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>You can use the Apache module mod_gzip which compresses the libraries on the fly.</li>
                <li>
                    You can compress the libraries manually using the gzip command, rename them to remove the .gz suffix
                    and add the header using an Apache directive
                    (eg <span style="background-color: #C5FFC5; padding: 1px">AddEncoding gzip .js</span>). If you have some sort of
                    release process/script, it would make sense to add this to it to automate the procedure.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Minification</b><br />
            Minification reduces the size of the library before compression takes effect, removing unnecessary spaces and comments etc.
            A combination of minification and compression will give superb results. For example, before being split up into seperate files,
            minification combined with compression reduced the common library from over 100k to roughly 10k (!). There is a PHP shell
            script that you can use to minify the libraries in the scripts directory.

            <p>
                You can get pre-minified versions of the libraries <a href="http://www.rgraph.net/RGraph.minified.zip">here</a>.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <p>

        <li>
            <b>Pre-emptive caching</b><br />
            Slightly different to caching itself, is pre-emptive caching. This involves downloading the libraries before the page that requires
            them is shown. This way, they're already in the users browser cache and the graph will subsequently appear to be much much
            quicker. An example of this would be having the library included at the bottom of your index page of your website (optionally
            with the <b>defer="defer"</b> attribute). The script can be downloaded at will because the page doesn't actually use it, but
            for subsequent pages it will already be in the users browser cache.
            
            <p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Caching</b><br />
            Since the libraries you're using won't change that often, you can set distant Expires: headers on them, or appropriate
            Cache-Control: headers, and the client will not even have to contact your server for it. When you want to make sure
            the library is re-downloaded (eg. you update the library), then simply change the filename.
            
            <p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Script tag placement</b><br />
            According to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/" target="_blank">Yahoo! guidelines</a> placing the &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
            tag at the bottom of the page can increase the percieved load time. If you do this, then your graphs should be
            created in the window.onload event, otherwise the browser may try to create them without the library
            having been loaded, and will therefore subsequently fail.

            <p>

            You should also consider the effect that this has when your page is rather weighty. If the page is weighty there
            will be a small delay before the onload event fires, and therefore creates the graph. This might not be so bad if the
            graph is not immediately visible, however if it is then you should carefully consider using the onload event. You
            may wish to load the library in the page header, define the canvas tag and then immediately define the javascript that creates the graph. This way
            the graph will be created and shown, and then the rest of the page loads. The end result is that your graph
            appears to be faster.
            
            <p />
            
            Between the onload event, asychronous Javascript and careful tag placement, you will need to experiment to get the right result
            for you.

        <li>
            <b>Document structure</b><br />
            The structure of your document can have a significant impact on how fast your graphs are displayed. If, for example, you use
            tables for layout, this can delay the display of elements that are affected by the size of the table. Where possible, you
            should consider trying to convert your layout to DIVs. An example of this is the front page of this website. The graphs
            were right aligned using a table as a container. This caused a visible delay when showing them. In this case it was a
            simple matter to convert the page to use DIVs, and the page subsequently displays much faster.
            <p />
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Creating your graphs asynchronously</b><br />
            Where possible, you may wish to create your graphs asynchronously. This allows the browser to continue rendering the page
            immediately after getting to the code that creates the graph. This might not be perceptible if you don't have a lot of
            graphs, or your page is small. You can read a little more about this and see example code <a href="async.html">here</a>.

            <p />
            
            Note that recent releases of Google Chrome (from a dev release of version 4) have had an issue with creating graphs
            asynchronously, which presents itself by not drawing text sometimes (it's not consistent). Simply not using
            asynchronous graph production in this case resolves the issue.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>DOMContentLoaded event</b><br />
            Using this event can speed up the display of your graphs signifcantly compared to the more well known <i>onload</i> event.
            It is supported by Chrome, Gecko based browsers (ie Firefox), Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer 9. This event fires when
            the structure of the page is loaded, but not necessarily the images or CSS. This means that if your page is laden with
            images, this event will fire before the onload event, thus creating your graphs quicker. The effect can be very noticeable.
            
            <pre class="code">
function addListener(func)
{
    if(window.addEventListener) {
        window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', func, false);
    } else {
        document.attachEvent("onDOMContentLoaded", func);
    }
}
</pre>
            You can read more about the <i>DOMContentLoaded</i> event on the Mozilla site, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko-Specific_DOM_Events" target="_blank">here</a>,
            and the Microsoft site <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/HTML5/87DOMContent-Loaded/Default.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            There's an example <a href="domcontentloaded.html">here</a>.

        <li>
            <b>AJAX requests</b><br />
            If you can take advantage of AJAX, you can use this method to retrieve data from your server. If, for example, you have a graph that
            shows ongoing information, instead of simply refreshing the entire page, you could use an AJAX request to just retrieve the
            data that you want and update the graph that way. This reduces the amount of data needed to be transferred, thus reducing the
            bandwidth used, and will be quicker than a full page refresh, particularly if your page is weighty. There's a simple AJAX
            function that you can use <a href="#ajax">below</a>.
            <p />
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Combining libraries</b><br />
            If your performance requirements are extreme, then you may wish to consider combining the libraries into a single file.
            This won't save on the size of the individual libraries, but will save on the headers that are sent as part of the response.
            If a typical response sends 500 bytes worth of headers, and you send four graph libraries, then combining the libraries
            would save 1500 bytes. Multiple factors need to be considered though, including things like caching, which can circumvent
            the unneccessary repeated downloading of the libraries.
            
            <p>
                Another effect of combining libraries is reducing the amount of HTTP connections needed to retrieve them. Most browsers
                have a limit on how many connections they can create simultaneously, so if they're not being used to retrieve your
                graph libraries, they can be used for something else. Reducing the number of HTTP connections also eliminates the time
                spent setting up those connections.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>A reasonable performance strategy</b>
    
    <p>
        Although there's a lot you can do in regards to performance, a few of the points here will suffice for most
        websites:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Compression</li>
            <li>Minification</li>
            <li>Pre-emptive caching</li>
            <li>Caching</li>
        </ul>
        
        The number one thing you should do is compress your libraries. This has multiple benefits and provides by far the most gain,
        effectively for free. Secondly, use the minified libraries. Since you can download them <a href="../RGraph.minified.zip">here</a>,
        you might as well use them. Then we have pre-emptive caching. Since most websites won't show graphs on the front page or will
        have a login page that is shown before any graphs, this effectively eliminates the graph library download. And lastly caching
        should be done as a matter of course. There's no reason to keep downloading the same library so even caching for only 30 minutes
        (or the duration of an average visit to your website) will produce results.

    <h2>Implementing RGraph</h2>
    
    <p>
        Getting RGraph up and running is very easy and consists of three steps. If you're having trouble I suggest you get hold of a copy of
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> along with <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com" target="_blank">Firebug</a> - its
        Javascript error console will make debugging your issue much easier. Many problems are down to a library not having been included or
        not using the onload event when you need to. You might also benefit from using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">Web Developer toolbar</a>
        for Firefox. This allows you to easily disable caching, thus eliminating any problems that that causes. You could equally use
        the Chrome developer tools (CTRL+SHIFT+J), optionally in docked mode, which also provides a good quality Javascript console.

        <li>
            Add the canvas tag (put it where you want the graph to appear):
<pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="myCanvas" width="600" height="250"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            Create the graph (since it is using the onload event, you can put this anywhere):
            
<pre class="code">
&lt;script&gt;
    window.onload = function ()
    {
        var data = [280, 45, 133, 166, 84, 259, 266, 960, 219, 311, 67, 89];

        var bar = new RGraph.Bar('myCanvas', data);
        bar.Set('chart.labels', ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']);
        bar.Set('chart.gutter', 35);
        bar.Draw();
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There's also a very <a href="../examples/basic.html">basic example</a> of using RGraph, that does very little. It can be helpful to
        illustrate how you can get RGraph up and running.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Common library split (17th April 2010)</h4>
    <p>
        The common library has now been split into separate files. This was because the single common library had become far too large.
        If you don't use any of the dynamic features, then you still need to change your code, as <i>RGraph.common.js</i> is now
        called <i>RGraph.common.core.js</i>.
    </p>
    
    <a name="structure"></a>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
    <h2>Suggested structure for RGraph</h2>
    
    <img src="../images/structure.png" width="175" height="205" alt="Suggested structure for RGraph" style="float: right" />
    
    <p>
        The suggested layout structure for the RGraph libraries is shown on the right. The <b>www.example.com</b> folder represents
        the root/top level of your website with the <b>javascript</b> directory beneath that. The <b>css</b> and <b>images</b>
        folders are shown for
        illustrative purposes only. If you follow this layout then your URLs to the RGraph libraries would be:
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>/javascript/rgraph/RGraph.common.core.js</b><br />
        <b>/javascript/rgraph/RGraph.bar.js</b><br />
        etc
    </p>
    
    <p>
        By using this structure you make RGraph easy to update should you need to, and also keep all the RGraph libraries in
        one, easy to find, place.
    </p>

    <br clear="all" />

    <a name="integration"></a>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />
    <h2>Integration with server side scripting</h2>
    
    <p>
        This is a very easy process, as easy as sending content to the browser. All you need to do is make the <i>data</i> variable
        (as in the example below) contain the data you want to be displayed. Eg:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;canvas id="myCanvasTag" width="600" height="200"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;/canvas&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    data = [78,16,26,23,25,51,34,64,84,84];

    line = new RGraph.Line("myCanvasTag", data);
    line.Set("chart.labels", ["Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"]);
    line.Draw();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    <p>
        To get the above using PHP you could do this:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">&lt;?php
    // This simply makes a string out of the array of data
    $myData = join(',', array(78,16,26,23,25,51,34,64,84,84));

    // This prints out the required HTML markup
    print('&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;' . "\n");
    print('&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;' . "\n\n");
    print('&lt;canvas id="myCanvasTag" width="600" height="200"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;/canvas&gt;' . "\n\n");
    print('&lt;script&gt;' . "\n");
    print('    var data = [' . $myData . '];' . "\n\n");
    print('    var line = new RGraph.Line("myCanvasTag", data);' . "\n");
    print('    line.Set("chart.labels", ["Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"]);' . "\n");
    print('    line.Draw();' . "\n");
    print('&lt;/script&gt;');
?&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
        Strictly speaking the <span style="font-family: Monospace">var</span> isn't necessary, however if you put the code inside a
        function (like window.onload), it's probably best to do so as using <span style="font-family: Monospace">var</span> will
        make the variable local, and not global. So doing so will help prevent naming clashes.

    <h4>Making AJAX requests</h4>

        <p style="background-color: #ffa; padding: 3px; border: 1px dashed black">
            <b>Note:</b>
            It is important that you're careful with types when making AJAX requests. Since the response is initially a string,
            and your AJAX function/library may not do conversions for you, you may need to convert these strings to numbers. To
            do this you can use the <i>Number()</i> or <i>parseInt()</i> functions. For example:
        </p>

        <pre class="code">
&lt;script&gt;
    num = Number('23');
    num = parseInt('43');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

        <p>
            Here is a simple function that you could use to get data from your server using AJAX:
        </p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script&gt;
    /**
    * Makes an AJAX call. It calls the given callback (a function) when ready
    * 
    * @param string   url      The URL to retrieve
    * @param function callback A function object that is called when the response is ready, there's an example below
    *                          called "myCallback".
    */
    function AjaxCall (url, callback)
    {
        // Mozilla, Safari, ...
        if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
            var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
        
        // MSIE
        } else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
            var httpRequest = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
        }
        
        httpRequest.onreadystatechange = callback;
        
        httpRequest.open('GET', url, true);
        httpRequest.send();
    }


    /**
    * This sample callback function is called when the data is ready (readyState=4)
    */
    function myCallback ()
    {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
            // Everything is good, the response is received
            alert(this.responseText);
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>And you would use it like this:</p>
    
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script&gt;
    AjaxCall('http://www.example.com/getSomething.php', myCallback);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
        Support is available via a Google Groups forum. If you think that the issue you have is common, try the <a href="issues.html">issues</a>
        page first, and then try searching the forum in case your question has been answered previously. If that all yields nothing,
        post a question to the forum.
